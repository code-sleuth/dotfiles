  # Host-specific configuration for Ibrahims-Thanos
  # This file can contain machine-specific settings, overrides, or additional packages
  
  # For now, this inherits all configuration from common files
  # Add any Ibrahims-Thanos specific settings here in the future
  
  # Examples of what could go here:
  # - Additional homebrew casks specific to this machine
  # - Different system defaults
  # - Machine-specific environment variables
  # - Host-specific networking configuration
